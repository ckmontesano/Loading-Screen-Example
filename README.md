# Loading-Screen-Example
This example really only works with vanilla HTML, CSS (generated from SCSS), and JavaScript. It uses `addEventListener` which is added to the `window` element and takes in `load`, which tells it to fire the code within once the page is fully loaded. This allows us to hide and show the loading screen and content as needed.
